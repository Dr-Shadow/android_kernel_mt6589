This is a kernel source for MT6589

Actually the list of supported devices :
	Faea F2S (half of Faea F2S are supported, the ones with FT5216 for touchpanel)

If you want to add a device, please send a device kernel source (pure mediatek source) at xda (@Dr-Shadow) on private message

There is a commit history built but this is not the final release yet.

The final release will strip mtk build scripts and show the real commit history of mtk kernel.
